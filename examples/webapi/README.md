# Auth0 + ASP.NET WebAPI Seed
This is the seed project you need to use if you're going to create an ASP.NET WebAPI application.

This example is deployed in an Azure Web Site at https://auth0-aspnet-webapi.azurewebsites.net.

#Running the example
In order to run the example you need to have Visual Studio 2013 installed.

You also need to set the ClientSecret and ClientId of your Auth0 app in the web.config file. To do that uncomment the following lines and replace the values for each setting:
```CSharp
<!--<add key="Auth0ClientID" value="PROVIDE CLIENT ID HERE"/>-->
<!--<add key="Auth0ClientSecret" value="PROVIDE CLIENT SECRET HERE"/>-->
```

After that just press **F5** to run the application. It will start running in port **3001**. If you browse to [http://localhost:3001/ping](http://localhost:3001/ping) you should receive a response message.
